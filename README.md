# Intro To Self Driving Cars Nanodegree

I completed the Intro To Self Driving Cars Nanodegree by Udacity on May 16th, 2020. I had the opportunity to sharpen my python skills, apply C++, implement matrices and calculus in code, and touch on computer vision and machine learning all in the context of solving self-driving car problems.
